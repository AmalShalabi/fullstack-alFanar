# 4 Pillars Of Object-Oriented Programming/OOP

spaghette code : is so much interdependence between all these functions become problematic.

## In OOP

- We combine a group of related variables and functions into a unite and we call that unite an object.
- We refer to these variables as properties and the function as methods .

# 1- Encapsulation:
- Reduce Complexity.
- Increase Reusability.

## Example : 
grouping functions and variables in the  <b>Car Object<b> 

#### properties
make 
model 
color
-------------
#### methods
start ()
stop()
move()

# 2- Abstaction :
We can hide some of the properties and methods from the outside and this gives us a couple of benefits:
* Simple interface
* Reduce the impact of change.

# 3- Inheritance : 
Helps us eliminate redundant code.

# 4- Poly morphism
To render method that will behave differently depending on the type of the object that we are referencing.
